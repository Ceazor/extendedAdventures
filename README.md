## ExtendedAdventures

- **boar adventure:** fork from ['the cellar'](https://ftmscan.com/address/0x2A0F1cB17680161cF255348dDFDeE94ea8Ca196A). Boar population increases when someone calls `reproduce()`, and decreases when `kill()` is called. You receive rewards in both cases, varying according to different attributes. You can simulate both functions calling `simulate_reproduce()`, and `simulate_kill()`.
